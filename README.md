# REACTivities
Currently learning about React using Redux and Hooks by creating sample applications and saving via git.

An application I'm proud of is a YouTube page under video-hooks.
This application uses only hooks patterns in React and operates the same way as YouTube using the YouTube API provided by 
Google Developer Tools.

Using modern React with Redux, my end goal is to develop create modern UI with data visualization.
